##Objective

The `h5dumpImport` package provides a platform independent way to import HDF5 (.h5) file's datasets with compound datatypes while hiding much of the HDF5 implementation from the user.

**Currently, the `h5dumpImport` package does not directly import the HDF5 (.h5) file format.  The `h5dumpImport` package imports an ASCII dump of a dataset generated by the `h5dump` command line tool.**

Source code and pre-built binary distributions of the HDF5 Software which includes the `h5dump` command line tool can be found at the The HDF Group's [website](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html#obtain).

Alternative methods for importing HDF5 (.h5) files into *Mathematica* include:

- *Mathematica* 8.0's `Import` function provides limited support for importing HDF5 (.h5) files. `Import` currently does not support datasets with compound datatypes.  For example:

        In[1]:=	 Import["testData.h5", {"Data", 1}]
        Out[1]=  {"Unsupported Datatype Class", "Compound"}

        In[2]:=  Import["testData.h5", {"Datasets", 1}]
                 Import::h5type: The datatype of the dataset "/AllDatatypes" is not currently supported. >>
        Out[2]=  $Failed


- Scot Martin's [HDF5 API wrapper package](http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/contrib/mathematica/) is a solution for installations of *Mathematica* running on Windows.

##Installation
1. Download and install the HDF5 Software which includes the `h5dump` command line tool from The HDF Group's [website](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html#obtain).

2. Download the `h5dumpImport` package to a directory where *Mathematica* can find it.

3. In a *Mathematica* Notebook, execute the expression:

        Needs["h5dumpImport`"]

##Usage
1. Use *Mathematica*'s `Import` function to query the available datasets in the HDF5 (.h5) file:

        In[3]:=  Import["testData.h5", {"Datasets"}]
        Out[3]=  {"/AllDatatypes", "/Fruit"}
 
2. Create an ASCII dump file for the HDF5 (.h5) file's dataset using the `h5dump` convenience function in the `h5dumpImport` package:
        
        In[4]:=  dumpFile = h5dump["/usr/bin/h5dump", "testData.h5", "/AllDatatypes"];
An alternative is to use the 'h5dump' command line tool:
   
        $ h5dump -d /AllDatatypes testData.h5 > /tmp/h5dump_testData.h5_AllDatatypes.txt
        $
        
3. Create an `h5dumpImport` object, read all the data, and close :

		In[5]:=  dumpImport = h5dumpImportNew[h5dumpImport[], dumpFile];
                 dumpImport.h5dumpImportData[All]
                 dumpImport.h5dumpImportClose[];
        Out[5]=  {{1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111, 111111, 1111111, 1.1, 11.11, "one"},
                  {2, 22, 222, 2222, 22222, 222222, 2222222, 2.2, 22.22, "two"},
                  {3, 33, 333, 3333, 33333, 333333, 3333333, 3.3, 33.33, "three"}}

##Documentation
1. `h5dumpImport` package usage information. After loading `h5dumpImport` package in a *Mathematica* Notebook, execute the following expression:
        
        ?h5dumpImport`*
Click on the function names to see the usage information.

2. "h5dumpImport Examples.nb" contains a set of examples.

3. `h5dumpImport` unit tests in h5dumpImport.mt.  
   *Note: Wolfram Workbench 2.0 is required to run the unit tests.*


##Known Limitations / Areas for Improvement / Seeking Collaborators

1. The dependency on `h5dump` command line tool to extract an ASCII dump of a dataset from HDF5 (.h5) files is a time and disk space consuming step, that could be eliminated by directly reading the binary data from the HDF5 (.h5) file.
<p>*Seeking a collaborator with experience parsing binary data within Mathematica and who understands the HDF5 (.h5) file format.*

2. The parsing of the ASCII dump file data needs to be optimized. For a given amount of data, the time to read (and parse) the data is an order of magnitude greater than it is to fast forward (read without parsing) through it.
<p>*Seeking a collaborator with seasoned Mathematica experience in reading and parsing strings.*

3. Handling the enumerated datatype (H5T_ENUM).  I was not able to successfully generate an HDF5 (.h5) file with enumerated data.
<p>*Seeking a collaborator who can generate a valid HDF5 (.h5) file with a compound dataset that has an enumerated datatype.*

4. Support for datasets without compound datatypes.
